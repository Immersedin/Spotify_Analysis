# Data Pre-processing Description
We obtained the data from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabminamedez/spotify-data/master/data.csv. We first remove two unnecessary variables, 'id' and 'release_date'. Coulmn'id' contains all unique values, which is not useful for machine learning. Some information in column 'release_date' is included in the column 'year', thus we dropped 'release_date' to reduce repetition. In order to leverage the information in the original dataset as much as possible, we conducted feature engineering. Because both variable 'name' and variable 'artists' are of string type, which is not applicable for some machine learning algorithms, we decided to create 2 new numeric features accordingly. We created the 'NumArtists' which refers to the number of artists who created the song, and 'NameLength' which refers to the name length of a song. After that, we discard columns 'name' and 'artists', as they are no longer useful. Lastly, to reduce the computational time and avoid data skewness, we checked and removed the duplicated rows in the dataset.
